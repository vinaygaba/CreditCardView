CreditCard View ![Build](https://travis-ci.org/vinaygaba/CreditCardView.svg?branch=master) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.vinaygaba/creditcardview/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.vinaygaba/creditcardview) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-CreditCardView-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/1/2005)
==================

![Feature Image](images/Feature Image.png)

CreditCardView is an Android library that allows developers to create the UI which replicates an actual Credit Card.

Displaying and entering the credit card details inside the app has become a very common use case seen in a lot of different apps, but it is often represented in a not so intuitive manner. With Android Pay being announced at the recent Google I/O 2015, more apps would require users to input their credit card details. I created this library with the aim of making the process of displaying and entering the credit card details more visually appealing to the users of your app.

Features
---------

* Pre-built card backgrounds to help you get started quickly
* Fully Customizable
* Auto selection of drawables based on the credit card number pattern i.e. Visa, Mastercard,American Express & Discover. Will be adding more soon based on the requests I get
* Auto selection of logo drawable based on the credit card type i.e. Visa, Mastercard and American Express
* Editable and non-editable mode
* 4 different card number formats 



Setup
------
The library is pushed to Maven Central as an AAR, so you just need to add the following to your build.gradle file:
```java
dependencies {
    compile ‘com.vinaygaba:creditcardview:1.0.2’
}
```

Usage
------
Using CreditCardView is extremely easy, this is how you would declare it in the layout xml:
```java
<!-- Use <com.example.vinay.library.CreditCardView/> if you are using v1.0.1 of the library-->

<com.vinaygaba.creditcardview.CreditCardView
        android:id="@+id/card1"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="225dp"
        android:background="@drawable/cardbackground_world"
        android:layout_marginBottom="16dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="16dp"
        app:cardNumber="5500005555555559"
        app:cardName="Vinay Gaba"
        app:cardNumberTextColor="#cccccc"
        app:cardNumberFormat="masked_all_but_last_four"
        app:cardNameTextColor="#cccccc"
        app:type="auto"
        app:brandLogo="@drawable/brandlogo"
        app:putChip="true"
        app:expiryDate = "02/22"
        app:expiryDateTextColor="#cccccc"
        app:isEditable="true"
        app:validTillTextColor="#cccccc"
        app:hintTextColor = "#cccccc"
        />
```
Remember to put this for custom attribute usage:

```java

xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"

```
And this is how you would be adding it programatically in java:

```java
CreditCardView creditCardView= new CreditCardView(this);
```
OR

```java
CreditCardView creditCardView= (CreditCardView)findViewById(R.id.ID_OF_CARD);
```

Attribute Usage & Documentation
-----------------

![Attribute Description](images/attributeDescription.png)

##### I) `android:background`

Use this attribute to set the background of the card. This library includes 3 background by default which you can use, but **feel free to put any drawable and use it as the card background as you please**. If you do not want to use your own drawable and want to use the drawables available in the screenshots, do the following:

1)Sky Background

![Sky](images/cardbackground_sky.png)

To use this background,simply use the line:
```
android:background = "@drawable/cardbackground_sky"
```

2)World Background

![World](images/cardbackground_world.png)

To use this background,simply use the following line:
```
android:background = "@drawable/cardbackground_world"
```
3) Plain Background

![Plain](images/cardbackground_plain.png)

This is a customizable plain background where you can change the background color, radius and border color of the card. To use this, add the folowing line:
```
android:background = "@drawable/cardbackground_plain"
```

To customize the corner radius of the card, add the following attribute to your dimen.xml file with the attribute name "card_corner_radius":
```
<dimen name="card_corner_radius">size_in_dip</dimen>      //Default value is 10dip
```

To customize the background color and the border color of this card, add the following attributes to your color.xml file:

Additional Customizations
-----------------

My aim with this library was to cover as many use cases as possible and so I have tried to make it extremely customizable. There are some additional customizations possible like:

##### I) Modify String Resources

You can modify the hints which are displayed when the fields are empty and the card is editable. You can modify those by adding these attributes in the strings.xml file:

```
<string name="card_number_hint">hint</string>        //Default value: "ENTER CARD NUMBER"
<string name="expiry_date_hint">hint</string>        //Default value:"MM/YY"
<string name="card_name_hint">hint</string>          //Default value: "ENTER CARD NAME"
```
You can also modify some other additional string resources like:

```
<string name="valid_till">string</string>           //Default value: "VALID TILL"
```
The important thing to note is that the name of these items should remain the same. 
**Please make sure the string resources are in caps to be displayed correctly as the font does not support lower case**

##### II) Modify Dimensions

You can modify the dimensions of some of the attributes by adding these attributes to your dimens.xml file:

```
<dimen name="card_number_text_size">size</dimen>        //Default value:16sp
<dimen name="card_name_text_size">size</dimen>          //Default value:14sp
<dimen name="expiry_date_text_size">size</dimen>        //Default value:14sp
<dimen name="valid_till_text_size">size</dimen>         //Default value:10sp
<dimen name="brand_logo_width">size</dimen>             //Default value:120dp
<dimen name="brand_logo_height">size</dimen>            //Default value:40dp
```
The important thing to note is that the name of these items should remain the same.

Contributing
-----------------
Please use the issue tracker to report any bugs or file feature requests. There are a few features that I plan to work on based on the response the library gets, some of them being:

* Tablet Optimization. The current version is not optimized for tablets
* Landscape Optimization. The current version is not optimized for landscape mode
* Credit Card back view to display the CVV number
* Animations and touch callbacks
* Stack View to display multiple cards

I would love to get more people involved in the development of this library. A lot of times people are not sure about how they should be contributing to open source. If you are one of them, this is a great opportunity for you to get involved. You can also reach out to me for any queries that you might have about this library.
